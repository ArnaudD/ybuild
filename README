This is an attempt to port YUI Builder to node.js

This tool relies heavily on external node.js modules to get the heavy lifting done.

The structure of the tool will initially comply exactly to the output of YUI Builder, you won't need to
change any build files if you have been using YUI builder previously.

Over time the build tasks may be written asynchronously to help with large builds.
